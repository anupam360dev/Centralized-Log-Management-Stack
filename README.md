# Centralized Log Management System using ELK Stack

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Centralized Log Management System** built using the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**.  
Logs generated by Dockerized applications are collected, processed, stored, and visualized in real time to improve observability, debugging, and monitoring.
